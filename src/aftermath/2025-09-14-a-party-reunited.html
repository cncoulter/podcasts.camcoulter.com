<p>Here’s what you missed in Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Campaign 2: Aftermath: Part 2: Session 1.</p>
<p>Russ Highfield came back to Geltar to celebrate his 43rd birthday. His friends Cass and Merida decided to throw him a party, and they rented out this fancy mansion event venue in the Parkside neighborhood. The venue was actually in the eponymous park, and Russ’ party was happening right next to a nighttime summer food festival. Delicious!</p>
<p>Levity Amastacia was back living with their siblings in the Order of Care and Harmony, and there were a few extra folks who had recently moved in. Mishka, agent of the Sorcerers’ Circle, met up with Levity, and they headed over to Russ’ party side by side.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the venue, Russ was chatting with Cass and Merida when — poof! — a package from Teddy Elm appeared, containing a little sweetcake, a potion for the inevitable hangover, and a compact medallion that actually let Russ and Teddy facetime for a minute before its magic faded away. Precious!</p>
<p>Soon enough, Russ, Levity, Mishka, and Nadya Silversong all met up, and — what’s this? — Nadya came with an elf woman from back home: Ravina Coralyssian Wystfallen, whom Nadya was already calling Cora, which by Usana court standards is a remarkably informal way to address someone.</p>
<p>Everyone looked great, by the way. Russ wore this plum shirt that had a summer neckline and gold flower embroidery. Levity actually took off their plate mail for once and instead wore a dark brown leather jacket over some classy robes. And Nadya wore this gorgeous silver and purple ballgown. That said, Nadya also hid some dark circles under her eyes and looked more gaunt and sickly than Russ would have expected.</p>
<p>They all dropped off their bags inside, and Levity had a few birthday gifts for Russ: a beautiful +1 arrow, some Dust of Disappearance, and a spell scroll for Locate Object.</p>
<p>The party went to a portrait booth and got a watercolor painting of their auras. Nadya’s aura definitely had some weird dark splotches that the painter quickly painted over as they finalized the piece.</p>
<p>Moody Shivers showed up and whisked Mishka away for some urgent Sorcerers’ Circle business. A minor boggle infestation, was it?</p>
<p>The remaining friends then went to a fortune teller’s booth, where Nadya was told: “Death surrounds you. A dance with death will yield the prize of a second dawn.”</p>
<p>The party and festival continued right up until, during the fireworks display, a tentacled froghemoth and nasty-ass acid troll fell from the sky mid-brawl somehow!?</p>
<p>Levity cast Calm Emotions and helped manage the crowd as Russ conjured a pack of wolves to attack the monsters and Nadya coughed up black sludge that then … crawled away?</p>
<p>Russ threw his two daggers into the troll and used his magical tattoo to pump some fire into his strikes for good measure even after the troll was already down. Levity dropped a Shatter spell onto the froghemoth as they ran up. Meanwhile, Nadya started caring for civilians who got fucked up the chaos.</p>
