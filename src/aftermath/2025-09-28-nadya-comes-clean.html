<h2>Transcript</h2>

<p>Here’s what you missed in Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Campaign 2: Aftermath: Part 2: Session 2.</p>
<p>We began with a flashback. Several weeks ago, Nadya arrives back home to Windemere Falls, in Fortune Forest, on the western coast of the country Usana. Her mother, Countess Daiphene (di-fene) Isabel Niloni (ni-lone-e) Aurelia, has thrown Nadya a welcome party. After catching up on all the social gossip with Viscountess &quot;Brindy&quot; Bellathon (an old family friend), Nadya runs into Ravina. They knew each other growing up, but not well. Nadya begins to share some of what she’s been up to over the past decade, and Ravina is quickly intrigued.</p>
<p>Back in the present, the froghemoth and the venom troll have just died, and Ravina has asked Nadya how she can help.</p>
<p>Ravina, Cass, and Merida helped people calm down and get where they need to be, as Russ, Levity, and Nadya tended to those who needed healing and care. Levity and Nadya cut open the froghemoth in an attempt to rescue two people whom it had swallowed, but unfortunately they had already passed away. Russ cast Revivify, resurrecting two shopkeeps who had died in the sudden violence.</p>
<p>Levity noticed strange lights fading in the sky above. With their Wand of Flight, Levity took to the sky to investigate. They identified an odd swell of magic just before it faded away.</p>
<p>Nadya asked Russ, “Remember that black sludge I coughed up? It wandered off. Can it be tracked?” To which Russ replied, “Sorry, you have sentient throw-up?” Russ did indeed track the sludge to a pair of footprints but lost the trail shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>City guards came to deal with the mess and form a report on what happened. They wanted to speak with Russ, Nadya, and Levity, who were already acquiring a reputation as heroes in the wake of the chaos. The trio identified themselves as the Circumstantials and gave an honest report — omitting the part about Nadya’s throw up.</p>
<p>Russ, Levity, Nadya, and Ravina said goodnight to Cass and Merida, and went inside their magically conjured cabin.</p>
<p>At this point, Nadya finally came clean with Russ and Levity about what had really been going on with her these past months: you know, just constant migraines, horrible unrelenting nightmares, and seizure-like episodes, all caused by her dickhead and highly suspicious patron who resides in the Shadowfell. Nadya said she was ready to break up, but she wasn’t sure how to make that happen.</p>
<p>Well, she had one lead: a hag in the Whispering Grove. Russ offered a less creepy idea: what if they go talk to Daegal Draigh, a university professor in Evamond who’s written academic papers on the Shadowfell? Also smut. They also write smut.</p>
<p>Ravina turned in for the night, taking Russ’ room in the cabin.</p>
<p>Russ, Nadya, and Levity spoke about Revivifying people and about the intricacies of souls and their connection to the material plane. They also talked more about Nadya’s scumbag patron. Russ and Levity agreed they could totally take him in a fight and found themselves a little excited by the prospect.</p>
<p>Nadya and Levity retired to their rooms, and Russ crashed on the couch.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, Ravina stepped into the hallway and sat outside Nadya’s door. Russ heard her, and they chatted about Nadya and about what’s normal and what’s new for the Circumstantials. Eventually, Ravina went into Nadya’s room and curled up in a chair, keeping an eye on Nadya while she slept.</p>
