Here’s what you missed in Dungeons & Dragons: Campaign 2: Aftermath: Part 2: Session 5.

After Nadya shared her story with Daegal Draigh, Daegal identified her patron as
the Desolate Grim, AKA the Netherblight, the Omen of Death, a manifestation of terror that preys on creatures tormented by grief, a thing of legend brought into being by the folly of mortals and supposedly locked away eons ago.

When Nadya shared about the parasitic bile, Daegal asked if she had started transforming at all. Nadya pulled back her shirt and found a faint patch of scaling growing across her back.

Daegal didn’t have more to offer, but he did suggest the group speak with Vaenik, a Shadar Kai emissary to the material plane from the Shadowfell. Daegal didn’t know how to contact Vaenik directly, but he knew they had a contact in the Sorcerer’s Circle.

The Circumstantials bid farewell to Daegal, and Daegal wished Nadya the best of luck, hoping that she would survive so that he could one day hear her full story.

Ravina then insisted they have a night on the town. This was, after all, her first night in a big new city, and they all deserved to let off some steam. Russ showed the others around parts of Evamond, eventually leading the party to a popular food stall serving international fusion street food outside an old temple to Ioun that had been converted into a nightclub.

Nadya wasn’t quite feeling it, so she dipped out and sat on a bench alongside the lake. Russ followed along to check in on her. Nadya shared that she was worried about becoming a horrible monster, and Russ reassured her that he and Levity would quickly kill her if it came to that.

Meanwhile, Levity and Ravina left the club and got some snacks. Levity told Ravina that they liked her and wanted her to stick with the group but also warned her against going with them to the Shadowfell. Ravina said that she wanted to help make sure Nadya doesn’t lose herself amidst all this horror.

The party reunited near the lake, and while they hung out there, Russ started teaching Ravina some arcane cantrips. She showed a remarkable aptitude for it.

Later that night, just before bed, Nadya shared the darkest part of her story with Ravina: how her old troupe was murdered, how she first encountered her patron, and how she, in an act of revenge, killed the people who had murdered her troupe.

In the morning, the group visited Fantasma, a magic shop in Evamond. They put down a lot of money, and bought a few different things—perhaps most notably, a planeswalker amulet that theoretically can transport the wearer and their friends to different planes of existence.
