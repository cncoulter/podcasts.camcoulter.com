Here’s what you missed in Dungeons & Dragons: Campaign 2: Aftermath: Part 2: Session 3.

We began with a flashback. Several weeks ago, Levity Amastacia returned to Geltar, in the country of Joinser, and resumed living with their siblings in the Order of Care and Harmony. Some new faces had moved in while Levity was away adventuring: we have Sister Handell, Brother Claw, Sister Galbraith. The morning after they returned, Levity sat in the kitchen sipping tea and reading while the youngest newcomer came downstairs: Sibling Sadao. Levity tried to make chat, friendly and amiable, but Sadao was a skeptical grumpy-butt and not into it. Sure, I guess Levity had lived here longer than Sadao, but where had they been the last couple months, you know?

Then, we hopped over to another flashback. At a dinner party in Kilmoff, the capital of Usana, Russ Highfield chatted with Vivacious Lackery, a merchant, and they shared some craft beer Russ had brought. Russ was looking to expand his family brewery business into Usana. He was also looking to catch some gossip. He eavesdropped on High Counselors Acalan and Featherstone while they worried about what their colleague Dareo was getting up to. Dareo is the High Counselor of Security & Defense and, as Acalan would argue, Dareo is someone who enjoys provoking conflict.

Back in the present, the morning after the froghemoth incident, Levity, Russ, Nadya, and Ravina spoke with Top Guard Barhourd about what happened. Nadya mentioned the black bile she coughed up, and Barhourd told the group to clean up that mess.

Fortunately, they had a lead: Julie had come to the station to report a missing person: her husband Niles. They live in the Parkside neighborhood, near the park, close to where the sludge has crawled away. Julie said Niles had been acting strange last night, stormed out of the house, and hadn’t returned home.

Our heroes visited a bar that Niles frequented. They learned that last night he went out back to settle some business with Y’ron, a gang leader whom he owed some debts to. No one had seen either of them since.

Without a clear lead, the party split up. Levity and Sadao had brunch plans with Whittaker Barrabai. Sadao left brunch with a mission and a potential adventuring party of their own, and Levity reconnected with a holyphant they had met in Barrabai’s garden once before.

Nadya and Ravina looked for Y’ron. They found his gang, and the gang tried to shoo Nadya away. In response, Nadya threatened to burn down their building in a bid to speak with Y’ron, but Nadya realized that he actually wasn’t there, so she turned around and left.

Russ trekked through the sewers and tracked down and knocked out Niles, who seemed to be in the process of transforming into some kind of monster. Russ brought Niles to the Sorcerer’s Circle hoping they could heal him.

Levity, Nadya, and Ravina met up with Russ, and they all debriefed the situation with their sorcerer friends: Mishka, Moody, and Elody, the last of whom bemoaned the immense paperwork this situation with Niles would entail. From the sorcerers, the party learned about several other unexplained surges of magic that occurred throughout the city the night before.
