Here’s what you missed in Dungeons & Dragons: Campaign 2: Aftermath: Part 2: Session 4.

Worried that Niles may have infected Y’ron, Nadya and Ravina led Russ and Levity back across town to Y’ron’s gang. As the Circumstantials arrived, they heard screaming, and inside they found Y’ron, half-transformed into a monster, standing over his gang members, now lying still on the floor.

Russ took down Y’ron with two shots, but then the gang members stood up, let out a mind-wretching howl, and attacked. Afflicted by fear, Nadya had a vision of one of the zombified lackeys appearing as someone she had revenge murdered in a previous life. As Nadya shook off the hallucination, Ravina charged into combat with a dagger Russ had given her. She stabbed one gang member before she was frightened and knocked out by another—and then, animated black goop crawled into her nose. Gross!

After the fighting, Nadya healed Ravina, and Levity cast Lesser Restoration, which caused the goop to drip back out of her nose. It seemed inactive, but Russ captured it in a vial for safekeeping, just in case.

Believing that the black bile Nadya had coughed up was now dealt with, the Circumstantials reported back to the Sorcerers Circle and Top Guard Barhourd before parting ways for the evening.

Levity’s hollyphant buddy visited the Order of Care and Harmony for dinner and talked about their own home—on the celestial plane! Later, Sedao returned home, exhilarated after having tracked down and killed a monster with their new adventuring party.

Russ checked in on the shopkeeps he had revivified the night before before sharing dinner with Cass and Merida.

Nadya and Ravina spent the night at Nadya’s old tenement building. Nadya, predictably, had nightmares and awoke exhausted as the group began their journey to Evamond.

After five days on the road, they arrived in the capital of Joinser. Russ visited Tared Adfiel, a professor of transfiguration who’s also his ex. Tared directed the group to Daegal Draigh, but then asked for a moment with Russ. That connection, sadly, failed as Russ proclaimed his betrothal! Leaving behind an embarrassed Tared, the Circumstantials found Daegel and began a conversation about the Shadowfell and breaking contacts with spiteful patrons.
